New Tab Page for Salesforce
=======================

###Search and access Salesforce and Chatter resources from your New Tab Page!

[New Tab Page for Salesforce](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-page-for-salesfor/bdkpbeeciefhcpfalplbnnfdkijejbmj?hl=en-US&utm_source=chrome-ntp-launcher) on the Chrome Web Store

This extension, when installed and enabled, will replace Chrome's new tab page with a page that has access to Salesforce and Chatter resources and search. See recent records, recent posts, and navigate directly to them in salesforce.com with a click.

Don't worry if you currently use the Google search bar and Top Sites of the default Chrome new tab page: this extension has that functionality as well.

**Note: this is NOT an official Salesforce project. Salesforce is not responsible for this extension.**

## Dev Notes
1. `npm install`
2. `webpack`
3. Load unpacked extension in chrome://extensions/

### Notes for me
`npm install salesforce-api-using-access-token@latest --save`

`webpack --progress --colors --watch`
